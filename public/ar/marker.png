This is a placeholder marker image file.
To test the AR functionality properly, you need to replace this with an actual PNG image.

For quick testing, you can:
1. Create a simple black and white pattern image (512x512px)
2. Use a QR code as a marker  
3. Use any high-contrast image with clear geometric features

Example marker images you can use:
- A printed QR code
- A logo with clear edges
- A geometric pattern
- Even a simple black square on white background

Save it as marker.png in this directory.
